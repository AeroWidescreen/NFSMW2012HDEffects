## FAQ
Q: What version of the game is this compatible with?  
A: This has been tested using the official Steam and Origin releases, version 1.5.  

Q: What are the system requirements?  
A: For 1080p, a GTX 1060 / RX 480 should be enough for the default configuration. Higher resolutions will require more powerful hardware.  

Q: My PC isn't very good, can I still use this?  
A: All settings can be adjusted in the INI file. If your PC was already capable of playing the game, you can basically get the same experience but with the benefits provided by this mod.  

Q: What is CinematicMode?  
A: It's a hidden setting that improves the graphics beyond what was originally possible. I suspect it was used for creating trailers and screenshots based on its behavior.   

Q: Does CinematicMode allow me to control the camera?  
A: No, it improves the graphics. It does nothing else.  

Q: Why do reflections still look blurry when viewed at a distance?  
A: This is due to mipmapping and materials. Applying 16x anisotropic filtering in your control panel will improve the quality, but I've only been able to verify this for NVIDIA graphics cards.  

Q: Why does WreckResistance not work during online multiplayer?  
A: I don't support multiplayer cheating of any kind. This feature was added to improve the singleplayer experience.
